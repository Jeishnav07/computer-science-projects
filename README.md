# Computer Science Projects

**Author:** Jeishnav Ganesh  
**Language:** Python 

This repository contains a selection of my personal computer science projects, showcasing programming, algorithms, and data visualization skills. The projects are implemented in Python with a focus on clear, modular, and well-documented code.

## Projects

- **Series Expansion Visualizer**  
  Computes and visualizes Maclaurin and Taylor series on a graph for mathematical functions and compares them to the true function, displaying simple error metrics.

- **SITA Airport Navigation Experiment**  
  Simulates airport navigation and pathfinding with A* while mimicking real-life GPS systems using Gaussian Noise and Anchor Points, comparing different paths and performance metrics.

## Usage

Each project folder includes instructions for running the code. Typically:

```bash
cd Project-1-Series-Expansion
python main.py
